    <p class="css-typing">There's a special kind of peace when you're able to finally fall asleep
(with a broken heart and a plagued mind)
Your mind
no longer wanders
Plans 
Prepares 
Or has to accept. 
Your heart
no longer aches 
Feels
 Senses 
Or has to heal. 
There's no more agony in living or loving. 
You just sleep. 
And breathe. 
your breathing... 
Stops playing the symphony of memory 
You stop counting 
Counting the number of breaths it's been 
since you last felt his words on the nape of your neck 
Tenderly 
Whispering
 I really do care about you 
I do love you ...I did love you
 I'll miss you 
"I just need to live"
 Suddenly 
everything seems to melt away.
But then the stars and the galaxies dance around your head
And they swim through his soul
And back into yours
Following the golden threads that once bonded you together
That now lay piled up
tattered and severed
Suffocating your heart.
And then the inevitable, an unstoppable force of nature,
light fills the sky
Gold black and blue
and you must awake
Only to find
That while you slept
The stars wept
And those tears pierced your heart
Like shards of glass
In your now broken reality.
But there's this moment in the darkness
Right before you see the morning light
When life creeps up from the shadows
And you're left helpless
In the dark.
It's an abyss
Full of sadness
Loneliness
Anger
Resentment
Regret
Hope
Acceptance
Pain.
It cycles again, and again.
And again.
You want to cry,
scream
Die.
And you have to decide
Do I open my eyes?
Do I face a world I do not know
Because without his love
I'm blind
And opening my eyes
sends those shadows ablaze
Within the fiery chaos of
Your worst nightmare
And you must live another second, minute,
hour,
Day
Without him.
wondering what he's feeling,
what he's doing ....
Who he's doing / Who he's loving
Does he feel safe
Supported
Loved?
Because if he had let you
You would've never stopped
Loving him
Supporting him
You gave yourself freely
And now are only left
punctured
burned
And abandoned
covered in wounds
From pieces of someone
That used to love you.
You now are at your core.
You bury yourself in your own warmth
Hoping for some peace.
But the warmth only reminds you
Of his once loving embrace
And you have to take that first gulp of air,
acceptance, the cycle continues, but now…
… You are living to survive.
And that can't be living at all.</p>
